# Bikesharing
##  Overview
This purpose of this project is to investigate how a bike sharing program operates in New York and to create a proposal on how it might work in Des Moines.

##  Results

- Looking at the image below, it can be seen that most riders rent bikes more in the evening with a peak at around 5pm. That means that if we are starting this bike sharing program we have to make sure more bikes are available in the evening.

- From the Trips by Gender chart, the heat map shows that more males rented bikes than females. But if you look closely at the parts showing the times when females rented bikes, it can be seen that it was during the peak periods in the morning and in the evening most likely when going to work and returning from work.

- Looking at the Checkout Times for Users chart, it can be seen that the graph peaked at around 5 and dwindled towards the evening.
