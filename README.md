This purpose of this project is to investigate how a bike sharing program operates in New York and to create a proposal on how it might work in Des Moines.

##  Results:
---
- Looking at the image below, it can be seen that most riders rent bikes more in the evening with a peak at around 5pm. That means that if we are starting this bike sharing program we have to make sure more bikes are available in the evening.

---
- From the Trips by Gender chart, the heat map shows that more males rented bikes than females. But if you look closely at the parts showing the times when females rented bikes, it can be seen that it was during the peak periods in the morning and in the evening most likely when going to work and returning from work.

- Looking at the Checkout Times for Users chart, it can be seen that the graph peaked at around 5 and dwindled towards the evening.

- Looking at Checkout Time by Gender heatmap, more males rented bikes than females. We could take a survey from females and find out why they don't ride bikes as much as men and see if there are any changes that could be made which could hopefully get more females to ride bikes.

This is the Gender Breakdown chart and once again it is obvious that more men than women rented bikes.

Looking at the heatmap below, it shows a higher density at peak periods in the morning and in the evening when people are most likely going to work or coming back from work. This means that there were more bike rentals at about that time.

We also wanted to see how many customers vs subscribers rented bikes. From the heatmap below, it can be seen that much more subscribers rented bikes than just regular customers. This is indicated by the density in the chart.

- Summary:
* From the results, it is clear that more males rent bikes than females. We could take a survey from females and find out why they don't ride bikes as much as men and see if there are any changes that could be made which could hopefully get more females to ride bikes.
* Also the time of the day is a very important factor to consider. Since there are more bike rentals in the morning and in the evening, we can arrange most of the maintenace on the bikes to be done sometime in the afternoon when there could be much less rentals.
* There could also be promotions to encourage more people to become subscribers. The more subscribers we have, hopefully the more bike rentals we will have.
