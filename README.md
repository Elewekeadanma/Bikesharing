# Bikesharing
##  Overvie
This purpose of this project is to investigate how a bike sharing program operates in New York and to create a proposal on how it might work in Des Moines.

##  Results
Looking at the image below, it can be seen that most riders rent bikes more in the evening with a peak at around 5pm. That means that if we are starting this bike sharing program we have to make sure more bikes are available in the evening.
